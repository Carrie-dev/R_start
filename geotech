# Description

# These functions are used to determine the factor of safety against shear 
# failure on slopes using infinite slope analyses (FSinf) or planar failure 
# analyses (FSplanar).

# Usage

FSinf(c, phi, gamma, gammaW = NA, alpha, D, zw, metric)

FSplanar(c, phi, alpha, L, W, u)

fsi <- FSinf(23, 25.1, 9.1, gammaW = 9.81, 20, 1, 0.5, metric = FALSE)
fs <- FSplanar(23, 25.1, 20, 0.4, 1,3)


# Arguments

# c   soil cohesion

# phi soil friction angle (degrees)

# gamma  soil unit weight

# gammaW unit weight of water (default = 62.4 pcf for English units; 9.81 kN/m^3
# for metric units)

# alpha slope angle (angle of failure plane) for infinite slope analysis; angle 
# of failure plane for planar failure analysis (deg)

# D     depth to failure plane

# zw    distance of groundwater table above failure plane (use 0 for a dry slope
# and D for a submerged slope with parallel seepage)

# metric logical variable: TRUE (for metric units: kN/m^3) or FALSE 
# (for English units:pcf) [this is needed if gammaW is unspecified]

# L length of failure plane (planar failure analysis)

# W weight of slope per unit width (planar failure analysis)

# u average pressure head on the failure plane (planar failure analysis)
